This is a photo of a bicycle, but due to the way the photographer framed it, it could be argued this is a photo of a river flowing through a town.

The bicycle is red and appears to have some form of a container on its rear wheel. It has a lowered bar presumably designed so that a person wearing a dress, skirt or kilt could ride easier.

The icon used for this app very closely resembles the bike in this picture. The website shows a page where you can buy a bicycle from Amazon.
